An ode to LabJack:: John 3:16-17 (edited)
â€œFor God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only lab undergraduate student, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. 
For God did not send his lab undergraduate student into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through his labjack data collection code."
